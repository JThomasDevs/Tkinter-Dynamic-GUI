### THIS PROJECT IS NOT MAINTAINED AND HAS ONLY BEEN PUBLISHED AS A DEMONSTRATION OF MY PAST WORK. ###
All images needed to run the program are included in the repository.
All package requirements listed in requirements.txt


The program started as an attempt at making a story driven game in which the player would make branching
choices that would affect the outcome of the story.

However, what I ended up with is a solid demo of my ability to create an interactive, customized GUI using Tkinter.

To start, install the needed dependencies and then run the gui.py file.

The program starts at page one of the "story", with ever present script and info boxes to the right (at one point
intended to serve the "player" game information).

On each screen, the player is presented with a choice ranging from two to four choices, all of which bring the
"player" to a new scene.
On each scene after the first choice has been made, a back button will appear in the top left of the screen.

The back button only allows the user to go back once, however. So if the user makes two choices, they
can only use the back button to go back once, at which point it disappears.

The most challenging (and therefore, most impressive to me) part of the program is the ability of the
customized GUI elements (frames, buttons, labels) to size dynamically with the window while
maintaining the correct layout (there is a lower limit to the size of the window where this holds true, however).
BUT I have also set a minimum window size that enables to GUI to always be displayed correctly to correct this.

Tkinter does not have built in support for this and to get it working correctly on my own was
both challenging and a rewarding learning experience.
